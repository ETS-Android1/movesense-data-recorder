# movesense-data-recorder
This is a on going project with the goal of developing a simple Android app to acquire IMU6 (acc and gyro) data from a Movesense device and save it as experiments. The app allows the user to save subjects and acquire data for multiple movements for a given subject. The data can be expoerted to .csv.

Data will later on be used on HAR. The goal is to train a ML model with to identify the movement being performed. The feature will be used for CrossFit to allow automatic computation of round split times for analysis of pacing and performance.

Many pieces of code were provided by Anders Lindstr√∂m at KTH mobile applications course in 2021.
